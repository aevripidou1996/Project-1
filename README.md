### It's All Eats

## Project Overview
This is a sumbission for the first groupe project of our coding bootcamp.

With this assignment we used real API's to create a functional website that allows users to:

search for reasteraunts in their area as well as around the world, the app will then respond by providing a list of resteraunts native to that speciffice area with their adress.

Generate random recipes from all all around the the world, while at the same time providing the user with a list of ingredients for a recipe while at the same time providing a detailed instructional video for the user to follow along with.
