### It's All Eats

## Project Overview
With this assignment we used two real API's to create a functional website that allows users to:

* Search for restaurants in their area as well as around the world, the app will then respond by providing a list of restaurants native to that specific area with their adress.

* Generate random recipes from all around the world, while at the same time providing the user with a list of ingredients for that recipe. It also provide a detailed instructional video for the user to follow along with.
